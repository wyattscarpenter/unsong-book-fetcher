One of the author notes links to these youtube videos, which we also include here in this github repo for posterity — although we don't include them in the ebook directly as this would multiply the file size of the ebook by 100.

One of the videos is 107MiB — too big for GitHub to want to host it! We also could not include it via git lfs because of https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/unsong-book-fetcher/issues/19#issuecomment-2482879452 ; so, "Mayor Ed Koch Tells About his Late-Night Meeting with the Rebbe [WZaSVyDVHe0].mp4" is stored in here as a multi-part zip file. Hopefully this is easier to most users than the obvious alternative of just breaking the file up on byte boundaries and requiring you to cat it back together. You may need to install 7zip to unzip this file? In fact, I think you do.
